    <h2>What is Inferential Statistics?</h2>
    <p>Inferential Statistics generally the technique that allow us to use statistics such as mean or sample standard deviation 
      to make generalization about population from which the sample were drawn. With the help of inferential statistics, it helps statistician come 
      to a conclusion and make a prediction based on the data.

              <p>Most of the time, statistician can only get sample out of the big population because acquire the whole population is expensive, take very
                long time and inefficient. While using descriptive statistics can help summarize the characteristics of dataset, 
                inferential statistics can help us make a decision and prediction about the larger population. 
              </p>
              <p>For example: Inferential Statistics:
                A statistician randomly select a sample of Computer Science in WA state, collect data on their final exam score and other features. 
                In this case, we can used inferential statistic to make estimates and test hypothesis about the population of computer science in WA based on the sample.  
              </p>
              <h3>1.1 Sampling error</h3>
              <p>
                Since the sample size is smaller than population, this might create a sample error. Sampling error which is the difference between population values 
                called (parameter) and called sample values called (statistics). 
                <ul>
                  <li>A <b>statistic</b> is a measure that describes the sample (sample mean, sample standard deviation)</li>
                  <li>A <b>population</b> is a measure that describe the whole population (population mean, population standard deviation)</li>
                </ul>
                Since in most cases, we do not know the real population parameter, we can used inferential statistics to estimate these parameter that will take the 
                sampling error into account. There are two types of estimations that can be used to estimate about the population: point estimate and interval estimate. 
                <ul>
                  <li>A <b>point estimate</b> is a single value estimate of parameter. For example, a sample mean is a point estimate of population mean</li>
                  <li>An <b>interval estimate</b> provides a range of value that a value of parameter expected to lie. A confidence interval is an example of interval estimate</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h3>1.2 Point Estimate</h3>
              <p>Point estimate involves the use of sample data to find the single value which is the best which is serve as the best estimate or best guess of unknown parameter. 
                <ul>
                  <li>For sample mean, median and mode, the calculation is the same as population. </li>
                  <li>Range is also the same calculation as the population </li>
                  <li>For sample standard deviation, the only different to population standard deviation is denominator. <br>
                    For example, For example: Find the mean of the following dataset:
                    56,35,45,67,12,24,48,55,58,30, mean= 43 <br><br>
                    <math><mfrac>
                      <mi> (56-43)<sup>2</sup> +(35-43)<sup>2</sup>+(45-43)<sup>2</sup>+(67-43)<sup>2</sup>+
                        (12-43)<sup>2</sup>+(24-43)<sup>2</sup>+(48-43)<sup>2</sup>+(55-43)<sup>2</sup>+(58-43)<sup>2</sup>+(30-43)<sup>2</sup> </mi>
                      <mi> (10-1) </mi></mfrac>
                    </math>  <br>
                    sample standard deviation = 17.31
                  </li>
                </ul>

              <h2>2. Confidence Interval</h2>
              <p>Confidence interval is used to estimate the range that a parameter could lie. It is useful estimate as it into account the 
                sample error. <br>
                While a point estimate give a precise value for each parameter, a confidence interval tells the uncertainty of the point estimate. 
                They are both useful for using together. <br>
                Each confidence interval associated with confidence level. A confidence level have the probability (or percentage) that containing the parameter 
                estimate if you repeat the study again. <br>
                Therefore, 95% confidence interval tells us that we keep repeat our study exactly the same way with a new sample 100 times,
                you can expect your estimate to lie within the specified range of values 95 of the times.Although, we can say that 95% of the time, our estimate will 
                lie between the range, you cannot say for sure that the actul parameter will. 
                That’s because you can’t know the true value of the population parameter without collecting data from the full population.<br>
                However, with random sampling and a suitable sample size, you can reasonably expect your confidence interval to contain the parameter a certain percentage of the time.
              </p>
              <p>
                 For example, you want to know the average salary of computer science graduate students from UWA. After collecting survey responses from a ramdom sample, you calculate point estimate 
                 and confidence interval. The sample salary of graduate student student is $56,000. 
                 With random sampling, a 95% confidence interval of [$50,000 $12,000] means you can be reasonably confident that the average salary of UWA computer science graduate was between 
                 $50,000 to $120,000

              <h2>3. Hypothesis testing </h2>
              <p>Hypothesis testing is a way for you to test on your experiments whether yoy have a meaningful result.
                The goal of doing hypothesis testing is to compare population or assess relationship between variable using sample. <br>
                Hypothesis testing or predicting are testing using statistical test. 
              </p>
              <p>Statistical test can be parametrics and non parametrics. Parametrics test make assumptionincludes:
                <ul>
                  <li>the population that the sample comes from follow a normal distribution. </li>
                  <li>the sample size is large enough to represent the population. </li>
                  <li>the variances, a measure of spread, of each group being compared to similar. </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Moreover, when your sample data is violated, non-parametrics tests are more suitable. There are many different statistical tests. 
                Statistic test includes:
                <ul>
                  <li>t-test</li>
